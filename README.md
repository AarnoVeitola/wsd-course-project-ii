# Project 2: Drill and Practice

This project contains a web application used for repeated practice of learned content. The application uses a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database). The project is deployed online at https://aarno-unique-wsd-course-project-ii.onrender.com. Admin features in the deployed application can be accessed with the same admin credentials as specified in the assignment description.

## Structure

### Services and controllers

The application contains five different services for querying the database. The services are used by six different controllers. Some controllers (e.g. **topicController.js**) use several different services. 

### Views

In addition to nine views, the project also includes one general layout and a partial used by the layout. The partial includes a navbar that is displayed on each view.

### APIs

The project also includes an API for fetching a random question and checking if an answer is correct.

## Access control

## Style
